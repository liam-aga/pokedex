This project simulates a working Pokedex (device from the Pokemon Franchise) using a Binary Search Tree (BST) to store and manage data for many Pokémon. 
The Pokedex allows users to search for Pokémon by ID, add new custom Pokémon entries, delete entries, and print the entire collection in various orders (pre-order, post-order, in-order).
